# About
Why did I make this?
- I made this because I couldn't find an application that did this specifically, only "nukers" and stuff like that. Also I didn't trust other programs as they always felt sketchy. What i've made here is a non sketchy, and simple way to send messages to channels using your bot! You can decide the guild and the channel in said guild to send a message too.

As of right now it doesn't have a working way with to listen for messages live so unfortuneately it is a one way thing. If you know how to make it 2 way, then please contribute! When I say "2 way", I mean after sending the message, have an option to allow it to listen for messages, etc.
